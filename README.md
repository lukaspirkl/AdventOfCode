# Advent of Code
My code to solve puzzles for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

This code is continuous work in progress as I am using it to learn C++ and
related tools ([CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Conan](https://conan.io/)).
Solutions to individual puzzles are written as a unit tests
([GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)) and when a puzzle is
somehow interesting to play with the executable is provided
(for example the [text adventure game](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/25) on
the [25th day of 2019](2019/Cryostasis)).
